# Probabilistic Artificial Intelligence
## Gaussian Process Regression
We implemented Gaussian Process regression from scratch and used it for the computation and estimation of the model posterior. Finally, we applied our method to a dataset based on space data.

## Bayesian Neural Network
We implemented a Bayesian NN and applyied it on the Rotated MNIST and Fashion MNIST datasets.

## Bayesian Optimization
We implemented Bayesian Optimisation to find the best hyperparameters of a model. In particular, the goal was to determine the value of a model hyperparameter that maximizes the validation accuracy subject to a constraint on the average prediction speed.

## Actor Critic Reinforcement Learning
We implemented a Reinforcement Learning Algorithm based on Actor-Critic that solves the lunar lander environment.
